# Chatbot Model

This repository contains code for a chatbot model that predicts user intents based on their questions. The model is trained using a dataset of questions and corresponding intents. This README provides an overview of the model, how to train it, and how to use it for predicting intents.

## Overview

The chatbot model uses a machine learning approach to categorize user questions into predefined intents. It leverages the ML.NET library, which is a machine learning framework for .NET applications. The model is capable of understanding the intent behind user queries and providing appropriate responses.
